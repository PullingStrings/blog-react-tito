          <p className="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Iâ€™ve worked in the performing-arts sector over the years, from social media monitoring, coordinating live music events and curating visual art exhibitions in Southern and Eastern Africa mostly.<br/><br/>Travelling between countries and continents, I often used my laptop to create personal sites for musicians and artists. To create these portfolios, I was using website builders.<br/><br/>They were expensive to maintain and limited regarding the scale of creativity and customisation for myself and ultimately the client. This is why, I decided that I would like to build my own website from start to finish.<br/><br/>Due to the limited resources and technologies back home in South Africa, I then moved to London and joined GA. I fully immersed myself in the web development community to unlock my potential in the digital sphere.<br/><br/>After discovering the various paths in web development, I learn and admire the fact that you can work in teams as a developer (like joining a band again). Getting my feet wet in front-end development is where I would like to start my journey with the possibility to later on jump back into back-end development to become a well rounded full-stack developer.<br/></p>
